    <h3>Plan Version 1</h3>

    <p> For our approach for this project we are planning on using the Waterfall approach, where our entire team will be focused on 
        completing one task/deliverable before we move onto the next. There may be times where a previous deliverable needs to be 
        altered slightly but ideally we will be completing each task one at a time. <br>
        <br>
        We have allocated completing Requirements, Architecture, Method Selection & Planning and Risk Assessment 1 week each, 
        leaving the remaining time to complete the code for a game. This schedule may change as with all 6 of us working on each 
        deliverable we may complete them quicker than expected. This would leave us more time to complete the Implementation 
        section at the end of the project.

    <h3>Plan Version 2</h3>
    
    <p> EDIT: <br>
        We have now changed our approach to an agile approach. This is due to us realising that it is more efficient to 
        have people working on multiple deliverables parallel to each other rather than the whole team working on one at a time. 
        This caused some confusion on writing within the documents.<br>
        <br>
        This will allow us to make changes to our planning/project depending on problems that may arise, rather than sticking to a 
        rigid plan. The Agile Approach is known to work well with smaller development teams, so it should work well for our project.

    <h3>Plan Version Final</h3>

    <p> EDIT: <br>
        For our approach for this project we are using the Agile approach. This will allow us to make changes to our planning
        project depending on the problems that may arise, rather than sticking to a rigid plan.<br>
        <br>
        The Agile approach is known to work ell with smaller devepoment teams, so it should work well for our project.<br>
        <br>
        We have extended the time for Architecture, Method Selection & Planning and Risk Assessment & Mitigation to 08/11/2024 
        to allow for higher quality in documentation. This is also due to Sam and Adam being confident in the Implementation 
        so that they would not require as much help from other members of the group.</p>
